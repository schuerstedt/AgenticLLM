* I want test done with Volcano https://volcano.dev/docs
* it should be linux/WSL enabled
* it should support automatic git cloning as well, e.g. the proxy can ssh into a remote machine, clone the desired git repo, install the cli, executes the cli in a worktree, merge everything back into the git repo
* it should implement history via AGENTS.md as well, so that the agent can learn from past
* it should write appropriate AGENTS.md (naming) like the cli expects them - check cli doc for that and inject that into the worktree.
* experiment with branching using Volcano, e.g. have different cli compete on a task, select the best, learn from each other
